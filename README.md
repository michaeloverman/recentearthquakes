# recentearthquakes
An app built as part of a UC San Diego on Coursera course on Java Programming and Algorithms.
Source code provided by course included skeleton of the GUI, and the connection to USGS for earthquake data and the initial parsing of that data. As part of the course, I built the algorithms which draw the markers on the map, crunch the data received in order to 'sequence' the quakes, etc. The personal "extension" I built into the program was the marker flags, showing the strongest (highest magnitude) quakes in decending order.
